Mobile App Development Course

1. What Challenges did you face installing Android Studio? 
- The difficult part of installing android studio for me is installing the SDK and having a problem with my internet connection. Therefore, it takes time for me to download the SDK.

2. What did you learn about Android app structure?
- The android app structure is very similar to Java structure. In framework and structure in coding. Moreover, I slightly have clear insights about the Foundation Layer that Android and iOS has (Linux Kernel and Core OS). I also learned about the 4 types of development; native, hybrid, cross-platform and progressive web app development.
